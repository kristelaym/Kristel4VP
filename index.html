            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Kristel, a second-year Honours Computer Science student, soon entering my third year with a minor in Math and Psychology. Since starting university, I’ve been actively involved in .devClub—first as a councillor, then as Internal Executive, and now I’m excited to run for Vice President. Being part of this community has helped me grow both personally and professionally, and it has shaped my vision for how .devClub can continue empowering students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last year, I focused on making .devClub a more inclusive space for women and gender minorities through initiatives like the Dress to Impress workshop. Seeing the impact of these efforts has been incredible—this year, we have more amazing women running for executive roles than ever before, compared to past years when there were only one or two women on the entire council, including councillors. This is proof that .devClub is growing in the right direction, but there is still so much more we can do. As Vice President, I want to continue this movement alongside so many others who are passionate about making tech a space for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond inclusivity, I also want to expand the learning and career-building opportunities we provide. I plan to introduce hands-on workshops led by our Computer Science faculty, ensuring that our members can learn directly from experts. Additionally, I want to organize industry panels and presentations featuring professionals who can give insight into the workforce, career paths, and the latest technologies shaping our field. These initiatives will help bridge the gap between university and industry, giving students the confidence and knowledge to pursue their goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                .devClub is a space where students can create, develop, and explore cutting-edge technology, and I want to ensure that every member feels supported on their journey. I’m excited for the opportunity to serve as Vice President and help .devClub continue to be a welcoming and empowering community. I look forward to the exciting year ahead and appreciate your support as we shape the future of our club together.
