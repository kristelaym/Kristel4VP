            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> \tI’m Kristel, a second-year Honours Computer Science student, soon entering my third year with a minor in Math and Psychology. Since starting university, I’ve been actively involved in .devClub—beginning as a councillor, then serving as Internal Executive, and now I’m excited to run for Vice President. These experiences have helped me grow both personally and professionally, shaping my vision for .devClub's future.

 \tLast year, I focused on promoting gender-inclusive events like Dress to Impress, fostering a welcoming space where students—especially those hesitant to participate—felt encouraged to develop their skills and build their portfolios. I'm proud of the progress our executive team made this year in fostering inclusivity and empowerment. A clear sign of this success is the number of incredible women running for executive roles—far more than the usual one or two.

 \tAs VP, I will introduce mentorship programs, collaborative workshops, and engaging networking events to further strengthen .devClub’s diverse and inclusive community. I aim to work closely with both the executive team and members to ensure our initiatives resonate with everyone, making .devClub a space where all students feel welcomed and seen.

 \tI’m enthusiastic about the opportunity to serve as Vice President and contribute to making .devClub an even more dynamic and inclusive space. I look forward to the exciting journey ahead and appreciate your support as we work together to shape the future of our club.</p>
