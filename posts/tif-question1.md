# What Interests you about Psychology?

I work in the **YoungMinds lab**, where we study **child development**. Right now, I’m assisting a graduate student in researching **what children consider private in HCI literature**, while she explores the **psychology** side.  

I’ve always been interested in **how the brain changes over time**—whether in **childhood, adolescence, or adulthood**—so this role is a great stepping stone for the **developmental psychology** courses I’ll take in the future.  

With my **Computer Science** background, I want to apply what I learn to **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** to design **technology that is both accessible and engaging** for different age groups.
