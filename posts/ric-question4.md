# Biggest Barriers Stopping Students from Getting Involved in .devClub

## **Imposter Syndrome**
Many students hesitate to join because they feel like they don’t know enough. They’ll say things like, “I’ve never built a website before” or “I’ve never made a game before,” and assume they need prior experience to participate. As a result, events like **hackathons** can seem intimidating, leading to **imposter syndrome** and making them feel like they don’t belong.

### **How We Can Help:**
* **.devClub** is meant to be a learning space, not just for experts. To reinforce this, we can continue to offer more **beginner-friendly workshops** clearly labeled “no experience needed.”
* We can also share **success stories** of members who started with little to no experience and grew their skills through the club.

## **Uncertainty About or No Interest in the Workshop Content**
Some students don’t get involved because they aren’t sure what to expect from workshops or how they will benefit from them. Alternatively, some simply aren’t interested in the **workshop contents**.

### **How We Can Help:**
* We need to **communicate event details more clearly**. Posting workshop breakdowns in advance, explaining who the event is for, and outlining what participants can gain from it will make workshops feel more approachable.
* Additionally, getting **feedback from the community** on what types of things they want to learn (such as Game Design or Web Development) will help us curate workshops that the community is more passionate about.

## **Academic Commitments**
Heavy course loads and other responsibilities make it difficult for students to commit time to extracurriculars, even when they’re interested.

### **How We Can Help:**
* To make it easier for students to participate, we can offer more **flexible event formats**, such as **shorter workshops** and **asynchronous learning opportunities**. This way, students can engage with **.devClub** without feeling overwhelmed by time constraints.
