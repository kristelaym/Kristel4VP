# Do you have any advice on how to succeed in MATH 1240?

I love this question! I was **intimidated by MATH 1240** at first, but going in with an **open mind** really helped. If you can, **study some basic logic before the term starts**—especially things like **De Morgan’s laws**—because if you’ve never seen logic before, it can take time to get used to the rules. The concepts aren’t necessarily hard, but they require **practice, understanding, and memorization**. Which, during a full term of courses where you also have to **practice, understand, and memorize** for other classes, is difficult already—so doing so in advance really saves you a lot of hard work.  

One of the **best things you can do**, and this is exactly what I did, is **ask your professor to grade your proofs** (like **induction** or **combinatorial proofs**) as if they were on an **exam**. This helps you understand **exactly what they’re looking for** and how they’ll **grade your work when it counts**.  

I want to preface this by saying I took **1240 in a condensed summer term**, so my experience is definitely different from most people, but the overall arching advice would be:  

- **Put in the time.** It’s easier said than done, I know, but that’s what you have to do.  
- **Don’t be afraid to reach out for help.** That’s a **BIG** one!
