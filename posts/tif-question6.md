# Are there existing connections .devClub has that you would (bring) for industry panels and talks?

Yes, definitely! We have some wonderful connections. For example, several of our past executives and members have built amazing careers at RBC—whether in Winnipeg or Toronto—and their journey from .devClub to landing great jobs is super inspiring. Imagine a panel where they share how they made the leap from university to the workforce and what employers are really looking for. That’d be a game-changer, especially for those not in co-op.

Additionally, I have a friend at Amazon Winnipeg who mentioned that not many people know what Amazon actually does locally, which is wild for such a huge company. It’d be awesome to have her and some colleagues come share what their day-to-day work looks like, the cool projects they’re involved in, and the key skills that helped them succeed. I think our members would really benefit from hearing their firsthand experiences.
