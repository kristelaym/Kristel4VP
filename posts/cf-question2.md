# Any plans that you want to work toward this year?

This year, I’m focused on two major goals that I believe will have a lasting impact on our **.devClub** community and beyond:  

### 1️⃣ Strengthening Inclusivity in .devClub  
Over the past year, I’ve worked to make **.devClub** a more welcoming space for **women and gender minorities** in tech, and I’m proud of the progress we’ve made. When I first joined, there were barely **one or two women** on the entire council (including councillors!). This year, we have **more amazing women running for executive roles than ever before**—which is incredible! But I know there’s still work to do.  

As **Vice President**, I want to:  
- Continue running **events tailored for women and gender minorities**, like **career-focused workshops** and **networking sessions** with industry professionals who’ve navigated similar challenges.  
- Advocate for more **inclusive representation in leadership roles**, ensuring that our club’s direction reflects the diverse experiences of our members.  

### 2️⃣ Expanding Learning & Career Opportunities  
One of my biggest goals is to **bridge the gap between university and industry**, so that students feel **confident and prepared** when entering the workforce. While theory is important, I believe students benefit most when they can **apply** what they’ve learned in practical, hands-on ways.  

To make this happen, I plan to:  
- **Organize more hands-on workshops** led by **faculty members** who can introduce students to advanced topics in a way that’s accessible and engaging. These workshops will give students a chance to **apply concepts beyond the classroom** and develop new skills.  
- **Host industry panels and tech talks** featuring **professionals from various fields** (e.g., software engineering, UX research, AI, cybersecurity, etc.), so students can learn about **career paths, job market trends, and must-have skills** directly from experts.  
- Work on **collaborations with local tech companies and startups**, so that students have access to **internship opportunities, hackathons, and networking events** that help them **build real-world experience.**  

I believe these initiatives will help **.devClub members feel more supported, connected, and prepared for their future careers** no matter what path they choose! 🌸 XOXO :3 🌸
