# How would you push for inclusivity?
Inclusivity starts by listening and adapting. Last year, I began by asking women and gender minorities what held them back from getting involved with .devClub and what type of workshops they’d be interested in seeing and attending. Their feedback highlighted interests in game design and Blender, which inspired initiatives like our “Dress to Impress” workshop.

Building on this, I’ve also worked to create a balanced leadership team. By encouraging underrepresented groups to take on councillor and executive roles, we now have an almost 50/50 gender split, making our team more representative of our community.

Overall, I push for inclusivity by engaging directly with those who feel hesitant, using their insights to shape our programming, and ensuring that every decision—from leadership recruitment to workshop design—reflects a commitment to diversity and equal opportunity.
