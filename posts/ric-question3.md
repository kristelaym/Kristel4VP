# **How will you ensure that the momentum you create in .devClub will be sustained and live on past the 2025-2026 academic year?**  

To ensure that the **momentum we create in .devClub** continues beyond the **2025-2026 academic year**, I will focus on **building a strong foundation for future leadership**.  

## **Recruiting and Mentoring Future Leaders**  
* A key part of this is **recruiting councillors** who share our **values and vision** for the club.  
* By **involving them early on**, they’ll gain **firsthand experience** in:  
  * How we **operate**  
  * How we **plan events**  
  * How we **foster an inclusive community**  

## **Passing the Torch with Confidence**  
* When these councillors eventually **step into executive roles**, they’ll already have the **knowledge, confidence, and leadership skills** needed to carry on what we’ve built.  
* This way, we can **pass the torch** knowing that .devClub is in **good hands**.  
* Ideally, they’ll continue this cycle—**mentoring the next group of councillors** and ensuring that the momentum we’ve created **doesn’t just last for a year, but for many years to come**.
