# What are some things you were able to achieve or your takeaways from your time as a councillor and Internal Executive?

## As a Councillor:
One of my biggest achievements as a councillor was having the confidence to put myself out there and apply. Going into university, I had no idea how clubs worked, and seeing that .devClub’s executive team at the time was mostly men, with the exception of lovely Avneet:two_hearts:, made me hesitant because I wasn’t sure if I belonged there. But thanks to the encouragement of Jordon, who was internal at the time, and Kha, who was external at the time, I pushed through my doubts and took that leap—and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

My biggest takeaway from being a councillor was everything Avneet taught me about promotions. I learned how to design posters, print them in the CADLab, get them signed for approval, and where to put them up around campus. These skills stuck with me, and I put them to use during this campaign—Milita, the amazing woman running for promotions, designed the posters, and I handled the printing and permissions on the first day of campaigning.
## As Internal Executive:
My biggest achievement as Internal Executive was making sure women and gender minorities felt welcome in .devClub. I was hesitant to apply in my first year because of the lack of women on the team, and I didn’t want others to feel the same way. So, I made it my mission to create a more inclusive space—and seeing that effort pay off has been incredible. I encouraged so many amazing women to apply for councillor positions, and now, we have an almost 50/50 executive team, including councillors. Even more exciting, many of these incredible women are now running for executive positions this time around! Knowing that I followed through on what I promised when running for Internal is the most rewarding feeling ever.

Beyond that, my biggest takeaway was learning my own limits. That summer, I was balancing full-time work, full-time summer courses (MATH 1240 and COMP 2140), and my internal executive duties. I thought I could handle it all, but I burned out to the point of missing meetings I was supposed to be hosting. That experience taught me that time management isn’t just about scheduling—it’s about knowing when to take a step back and prioritize my well-being.
