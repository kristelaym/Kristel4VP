# What would the content of the hands-on workshops led by CS faculty be?
Great question! One of our most successful workshops this year was led by Lauren, where she taught students how to create their own website, portfolio, or resume using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I’d love to expand on that by turning it into a workshop series, where participants can get direct feedback from Lauren on their websites and insights into what employers look for.

I’d also like to collaborate with other faculty members to host interactive workshop competitions, similar to the Battle Snakes workshop we held over a year ago. In that event, participants worked in teams to develop projects that competed against each other at the end. Bringing back this kind of hands-on, competitive learning would be a great way to engage students and help them apply their skills in a fun, practical setting.
