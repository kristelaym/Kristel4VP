# **What would be your favourite part about being a member of the .devClub executive team?**  

My favorite part of being a .devClub executive is that the team feels like **more than just an executive board—it’s a family**.  

## **There are two moments every year that truly reflect this:**  

### **1. Team Bonding Event**  
* This is a **planned event** that takes place at the **beginning of the year** with our councillors.  
* I still have **pictures and videos** from my first one, and so many **hilarious moments** happen during it.  
* It’s a time when we all get to **connect beyond our roles** and start **building friendships**.  

### **2. Late-Night Group Chat Chaos**  
* Every year, at some random point, something sparks a **late-night conversation** in our executive group chat.  
* I still don’t know **why it happens**, but it always does.  
* We end up talking about the **most random things**, and no one gets much sleep, but it’s one of those moments that makes being part of this team **so special**.  

Beyond the **responsibilities and challenges**, it’s these **experiences** that make .devClub such an **incredible community**, and that’s what I **love most** about being part of it.
