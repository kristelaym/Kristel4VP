# **How do you plan to build and/or improve relationships with other clubs, the department, UMSU, and sponsors?**

## **1. Other Clubs**  
One area for improvement is **strengthening our relationship with WICS**. Many may not know that the **Dress to Impress** workshop was initially planned as a collaboration with WICS, but **scheduling conflicts** led to it becoming a **.devClub-exclusive** event.  

To foster **better collaboration moving forward**, I have been **gathering feedback from WICS executives** on what makes **women and gender minorities hesitant** to participate in .devClub events. I plan to **continue these discussions** and work towards hosting a **collaborative workshop next year**.  

## **2. The Department**  
Our relationship with the **Computer Science department** is already strong, but I see an opportunity to further engage faculty by **expanding our workshop offerings**. Encouraging **faculty members to share topics they are passionate about**—similar to the **website workshop hosted by Lauren**—would **deepen our connection** with the department and provide **valuable learning experiences** for students.  

I hope to **reach out to more faculty members** to make this happen.  

## **3. UMSU**  
Our relationship with **UMSU** will benefit from my **close connection with Hannah Le**, the incoming **Vice President of Student Life** and a fellow **woman in Computer Science**.  

Having this **direct connection** will help **streamline communication** and create **more opportunities for collaboration** between .devClub and UMSU.  

## **4. Sponsors**  
**Strengthening our sponsor relationships** has been a priority for me. This year, during the **Dress to Impress** workshop, we involved our sponsor, **Niche Technologies**, by **providing them with a fully prepared laptop** to ensure a **smooth experience**.  

This allowed them to **interact with students directly**, assisting them with the workshop and fostering **casual conversations**. These interactions not only **improve our relationship with sponsors** but also give our members a **unique opportunity to connect with industry professionals in an informal setting**.
