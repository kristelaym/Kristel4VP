# How Will You Ensure an Increase in Hands-On Workshops and Industry Panels if Elected?

Our club already has several ways to make these events happen, and past experiences show that **clear communication** and **persistence** really work. For instance, during the “Dress to Impress” event, our sponsor **Niche Technologies** wasn’t even planning to show up in person. However, through many conversations and by clearly outlining what the workshop is about and what is expected of them, we convinced them to participate. This shows that when we provide a clear plan and enough reasons, both industry partners and faculty are willing to get involved.

## My Approach:

### **Start Small:**
* Begin with **sessional instructors** and **smaller industry professionals** to test and refine the event format. We might not nail it perfectly at first, but each event is a chance to learn and improve.

### **Clear Communication:**
* Prepare **detailed proposals** that explain the **benefits, goals, and expected outcomes**. When everyone understands what’s going on and what is expected of them, they’re more likely to join in.

### **Build on Success:**
* Use examples like the “Dress to Impress” event to show that even hesitant partners can be convinced with the right approach. This success proves that **careful planning** and **conversation** can turn a “no” into a “yes.”

### **Learn and Improve:**
* Understand that the first few events might not be perfect, but every **workshop** and **panel** is an opportunity to gather feedback and make adjustments. The more we do them, the better we’ll become, increasing our chances of success over time.

By following these steps and staying flexible, we can steadily increase the number of **hands-on workshops** and **industry panels**, making each one better than the last.
