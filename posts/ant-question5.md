# **What is one thing you can do for .devClub to improve on last year’s success?**  

One thing I’d focus on is **boosting inclusivity**. Building on my past efforts to create a **welcoming space for women and gender minorities** within .devClub, I’d work to deepen that commitment by:  

## **Listening and Adapting**  
* I’d continue **gathering feedback** from underrepresented groups to learn **what barriers they face** and what **workshops or events** would best support them.  

## **Collaborative Initiatives**  
* Strengthening our ties with **clubs like WICS**, we can **co-host events** (like the originally planned collaborative **“Dress to Impress” workshop**) to **reach a broader audience** and share **best practices**.  

## **Balanced Leadership**  
* I’d encourage **more diverse voices in leadership roles**, ensuring our **executive team reflects the community’s diversity**, which in turn fosters an **environment where everyone feels they belong**.  

By **centering inclusivity** in our strategy, we not only make .devClub a **more supportive community** but also set the stage for **richer, more engaging events** that students would enjoy.
