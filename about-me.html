                <h1>🌸 About Me 🌸</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="highlight">Hii, I'm Kristel! (✿◕‿◕)</span> 💻✨</p>
        <p>I'm a <span class="highlight">second-year Honours Computer Science</span> student, soon entering my <span class="highlight">third year</span>, with a <span class="highlight">minor in Math and Psychology</span>! 🎓📚</p>
        <p>Since starting university, I've been actively involved in <span class="highlight">.devClub</span>—first as a <span class="highlight">councillor</span>, then as <span class="highlight">Internal Executive</span>, and now I'm <span class="highlight">excited to run for Vice President!</span> 🏆</p>
        <p>Being part of this amazing community has helped me grow <span class="highlight">both personally and professionally</span>, shaping my vision for how <span class="highlight">.devClub</span> can continue empowering students! 💖</p>

    <h2>🌟 My Initiatives 🌟</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>✨ Inclusivity & Representation ✨</h3>
        <p>Last year, I focused on making <span class="highlight">.devClub</span> a more inclusive space for <span class="highlight">women and gender minorities</span> through initiatives like the <span class="highlight">Dress to Impress workshop</span>. Seeing the impact has been incredible—this year, we have <span class="highlight">more amazing women running for executive roles than ever before!</span> 💪💖</p>
        <p>Compared to past years, when there were only <span class="highlight">one or two women</span> on the entire council (including councillors 😳), this is a <span class="highlight">huge</span> step forward! But there’s <span class="highlight">still more to do</span>, and as <span class="highlight">Vice President</span>, I want to <span class="highlight">keep pushing for inclusivity</span> alongside others who care about making <span class="highlight">tech a space for everyone</span>. 🚀</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>✨ Expanding Learning & Career Opportunities ✨</h3>
        <p>I also want to bring <span class="highlight">more hands-on workshops</span> led by our <span class="highlight">Computer Science faculty</span>, giving our members the chance to <span class="highlight">learn directly from experts</span>! 📖👩‍🏫</p>
        <p>Additionally, I plan to <span class="highlight">organize industry panels and talks</span>, featuring <span class="highlight">professionals</span> who can share insights on <span class="highlight">career paths, workforce trends, and cutting-edge tech</span>. These opportunities will <span class="highlight">help bridge the gap between university and industry</span>, giving students the <span class="highlight">confidence & knowledge</span> to chase their dreams! 🌈💼</p>
    </div>

    <h2>🌻 Looking Ahead 🌻</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <p><span class="highlight">.devClub</span> is a place where students can <span class="highlight">create, develop, and explore cutting-edge technology</span>, and I want to <span class="highlight">ensure every member feels supported on their journey</span>. 💖</p>
        <p>I'm so <span class="highlight">excited for the opportunity</span> to serve as <span class="highlight">Vice President</span>, and I can't wait for everything we’ll accomplish <span class="highlight">together</span>! 🎉</p>
